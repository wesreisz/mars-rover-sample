1. Purpose
Enable NASA mission operators to simulate and verify rover movement instructions on a defined plateau before deployment, ensuring that final rover positions and orientations are predictable and correct.

2. Business Goals
Accurate Mission Simulation
Simulate rover navigation across a defined plateau grid using precise, rule-based movement commands (L, R, M).

Sequential Rover Coordination
Ensure rovers execute their movement plans in sequence to avoid conflicts in simulation results.

Predictable Final Output
Provide clear, unambiguous final position and heading for each rover after executing its instruction set.

Ease of Use
Allow mission planners to provide simple text-based input and receive equally simple text-based output without additional tooling or interfaces.

Validation & Safety
Prevent rovers from moving beyond plateau boundaries in simulation, preserving mission integrity and reflecting realistic operational constraints.

3. Success Metrics
100% Alignment with Expected Output for given test cases.

Zero Invalid Movements — the simulation must reject or prevent moves outside plateau bounds.

Usability — mission operators can run a scenario without additional training, using only standard console commands.

Repeatability — identical inputs always yield identical outputs.

4. Scope
Accept plateau dimensions and rover data in a defined text format.

Interpret and execute commands according to movement rules.

Output final rover position and heading for each rover in the order processed.

5. Out of Scope (for initial version)
Real-time tracking or concurrent rover movement.

Obstacle detection or collision handling between rovers.

Graphical user interface or visualization tools.

Error correction or recovery for malformed input.
