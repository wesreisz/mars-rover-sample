# Feature 8 Implementation Plan: Mission Record

## 1. Understanding of Requirements

### Specific Requirements from Story 8:
- Create a record `Mission(Plateau plateau, List<RoverPlan> plans)`
- Store plateau and ordered rover plans for sequential execution
- Preserve the order of rover plans
- Provide getters that return values as provided
- Simple unit test for construction & order verification
- No IO operations required

### Integration with Existing Functionality:
- Integrates with existing `Plateau` record (already exists in domain)
- Integrates with existing `RoverPlan` record (already exists in domain)
- Follows the same domain model patterns as other records in the codebase
- Will be used by future runner components for sequential execution

### Dependencies and Prerequisites:
- Depends on existing `Plateau` record in `com.example.mars.domain`
- Depends on existing `RoverPlan` record in `com.example.mars.domain`
- Requires `java.util.List` import for the plans collection
- No external dependencies beyond standard Java collections

## 2. Codebase Analysis

### Existing Patterns and Conventions:
- All domain objects are implemented as Java records (immutable data holders)
- Records are placed in `com.example.mars.domain` package
- Records have comprehensive Javadoc comments explaining purpose and usage
- Records follow naming convention with PascalCase
- Package-level documentation exists in `package-info.java`
- Test classes follow naming pattern `<ClassName>Test.java`
- Tests use AssertJ for assertions (`assertThat`)
- Tests include acceptance criteria verification methods
- Test methods follow descriptive naming: `methodName_condition_expectedResult`

### Integration Points:
- Will be used by future execution components in `com.example.mars.exec` package
- Complements existing boundary policy system
- Fits into the overall mission planning and execution workflow

### Reusable Components:
- `Plateau` record - already exists and tested
- `RoverPlan` record - already exists and tested
- Testing patterns from `PlateauTest` and `RoverPlanTest` can be followed

## 3. Implementation Plan

### Component/File Structure:
```
src/main/java/com/example/mars/domain/Mission.java (NEW)
src/test/java/com/example/mars/domain/MissionTest.java (NEW)
```

### Required Changes to Existing Code:
- No changes to existing code required
- This is a pure addition to the domain model

### New Components/Modules to be Created:

#### Mission.java:
- Java record with two components: `Plateau plateau` and `List<RoverPlan> plans`
- Comprehensive Javadoc documentation
- Package declaration: `com.example.mars.domain`
- Import for `java.util.List`

#### MissionTest.java:
- Unit test class following existing test patterns
- Tests for construction and getter verification
- Tests for order preservation of rover plans
- Tests for equality and hashCode behavior
- Tests for null handling (if appropriate)
- Acceptance criteria verification test
- Uses AssertJ assertions

## 4. Implementation Details

### Mission Record Structure:
```java
package com.example.mars.domain;

import java.util.List;

/**
 * Immutable record representing a complete mission configuration. Contains the operational
 * plateau and the ordered sequence of rover plans to be executed.
 *
 * <p>The mission serves as a bundle for sequential execution, preserving the order of
 * rover plans as specified by the mission operator.
 *
 * @param plateau the operational area where rovers will execute their plans
 * @param plans the ordered list of rover plans to be executed sequentially
 */
public record Mission(Plateau plateau, List<RoverPlan> plans) {}
```

### Test Structure:
- Basic construction and getter tests
- Order preservation verification
- Equality and hashCode tests
- Acceptance criteria scenario test
- Edge case handling (empty list, single plan, multiple plans)

## 5. Implementation Checklist

### ✅ IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:

1. Create `Mission.java` in `src/main/java/com/example/mars/domain/` directory
2. Add package declaration: `package com.example.mars.domain;`
3. Add import statement: `import java.util.List;`
4. Add comprehensive Javadoc comment explaining Mission purpose and usage
5. Define record with signature: `public record Mission(Plateau plateau, List<RoverPlan> plans) {}`
6. Create `MissionTest.java` in `src/test/java/com/example/mars/domain/` directory
7. Add package declaration and necessary imports (AssertJ, JUnit, List, etc.)
8. Implement test: `constructor_withValidInputs_setsFields()`
9. Implement test: `constructor_withOrderedPlans_preservesOrder()`
10. Implement test: `equals_withSameValues_returnsTrue()`
11. Implement test: `equals_withDifferentValues_returnsFalse()`
12. Implement test: `toString_includesBothFields()`
13. Implement test: `acceptanceCriteria_scenario1_constructAndRead()`
14. Implement test for empty plans list: `constructor_withEmptyPlans_allowsEmpty()`
15. Implement test for single plan: `constructor_withSinglePlan_preservesPlan()`
16. Implement test for multiple plans: `constructor_withMultiplePlans_preservesOrder()`
17. Run tests to verify compilation and functionality
18. Verify order preservation with different plan sequences
19. Verify getters return exact values as provided
20. Confirm no linting errors or warnings

## 6. Verification Checklist

### Requirements from User Story:
- ✅ Create record Mission(Plateau plateau, List<RoverPlan> plans)
- ✅ Store plateau and ordered rover plans
- ✅ Enable sequential execution by runner components
- ✅ Preserve order of plans
- ✅ Getters return values as provided
- ✅ Simple unit test for construction & order
- ✅ No IO operations

### Implementation Status:
- ✅ Mission record structure defined
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite planned
- ✅ Follows existing codebase patterns
- ✅ Maintains consistency with domain model
- ✅ Preserves immutability through record usage

### Assumptions and Decisions:
- Using `java.util.List` for plans collection (standard Java collections)
- Following existing record pattern with no additional methods
- Plans list can be empty (valid mission with no rovers)
- Plans list can contain null values (following RoverPlan test patterns)
- Using comprehensive Javadoc following existing domain object style
- Test structure mirrors existing domain object tests (PlateauTest, RoverPlanTest)
- No validation logic in record itself (consistent with other domain records)
